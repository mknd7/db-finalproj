TopicInner - tinnerid (pk), topicid (fk), topicname
(multi-level hierarchy of topics)

Answer - aid (pk), qid (fk), userid (fk), when, answerbody, best, upvotes

Constraints:
- status is one of [beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert]
- topic is a single keyword or phrase (not a set of keywords)


Assumptions:
- already implied: a resolved question need not have an answer
- already implied: every question is associated with exactly one topic
- username and email can be changed by user, so we have separate userid
- questions cannot be jointly asked or answered; every question and answer has exactly one user associated with it
- an answer's topic is inferred from its linked question's topic
